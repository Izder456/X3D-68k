TODO
	-Test construct_frustum_from_polygon3D()
	-Write function to clip a single line against the viewing frustum
	-Work out full details of algorithm to clip all 12 edges of the cube and propagate the edges
		instead of duplicating work and clipping each polygon (which leads to 24 clips)
	

	-Move code for the light bridge into a data structure instead of loose global variables
	-Remove sanity code in cross_product()
	-Remove the unnecessary debug statements
	-Change render_cube() to solely use 3D clipping instead of a hybrid 2D/3D

	-Modify engine to allow for generalized convex segments instead of just cubes -
		will require a significant engine rewrite


	-Determine why there is an address error when quitting (!)
