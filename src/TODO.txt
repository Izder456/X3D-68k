TODO
	-Write function to clip a single line against the viewing frustum
	-Work out full details of algorithm to clip all 12 edges of the cube and propagate the edges
		instead of duplicating work and clipping each polygon (which leads to 24 clips)

	-Fix wall embedding
	-Fix clipping effects from 3D clipper
	

	-Move code for the light bridge into a data structure instead of loose global variables
	-Remove the unnecessary debug statements

	-Modify engine to allow for generalized convex segments instead of just cubes -
		will require a significant engine rewrite




Completed
=============================================

*4/13/15*
	-Test construct_frustum_from_polygon3D()
	-Determine why there is an address error when quitting (!)
	-Remove sanity code in cross_product()
	-Change render_cube() to solely use 3D clipping instead of a hybrid 2D/3D
