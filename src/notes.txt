It appears that it's possible to enter a cube and draw it from more than one angle... this must be accounted for.

It turns out that the problem may be that I assumed that the e.g. the back face of one cube would always be
connected to the front, which is simply not the case in a Descent level... my solution to this involves storing
which face the cube is connected to

unsigned short cube[6];

CCCCCCCCCCFFF

F -> 3 bits for face id
C -> 10 bits for child cube

Note that it's still -1 if the cube has no child connected to it







The 3D clipper is suffering from problems with bizzare clipping effects (lines being drawn
all over the screen). This usually indicates that geometry is behind you, which leads to a
negative Z. Perhaps this is being cause because the camera can get too close to the wall.
